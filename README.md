# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The overview of this project was to learn the basics of Excel and become more comfortable
with trying to see the data for what it is instead of a bunch of letters and numbers.

We are able to actually see the correlation between the numbers and be able to present the data we've gathered in a
more digestive manor.

### Purpose

The purpose of this was to see the data visually to help Louise 
make smarter decisions with allocating funds and where she can make profit

## Analysis and Challenges

The real challenge is when you're working with a lot of data and cells not being filled out correctly.
It can get tedious for those who don't know Excel inside out, and it get extremely repetitive if one is
not familiar with the program at all. The data shown can only be customizable to a certain degree before you run out of options.

Although there was drawbacks on using Excel to create visualizations with the data, it is still a pretty good tool to 
use for smaller data, and for cleaning up data to possibly import to another program. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Looking at the chart, it shows a considerable increase during the years 2014 - 2017, 2015 being the highest outcome.
Although there were a lot more cancellations during 2015, the amount of successful outcomes outweighs the canceled ones 
by almost double the amount. They might have had more funding and took more projects on since they had more funds to work with. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

There is a high percentage of failed and canceled shows. And it is definitely more likely that these numbers will continue to decline throughout the years. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It doesn't factor in reasons, they're just numbers but there could be reasons why these failed/canceled results
happened. It's limited in a way that you can't just zoom in and click on a part of the graphs/charts made and get an exact number.

It only shows you the data, but looking at the visuals, you don't get much from it, but rather, just the overall picture
of the success rate. 

I'm not sure if linecharts were the best charts to use, maybe the data could be interpreted better using a pie or bar chart. 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
